A university assignment where we had to implement different algorithms to create a randomly generated dungeon with different rooms each connected with a randomly placed door.

The rooms and doors have nodes which are waypoints that are also connected. 

Recursive and BFS algorithms have been implemented to find the shortest path between any two nodes in the dungeon.
